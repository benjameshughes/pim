# Image Uploader Integration Summary

## Overview
Successfully integrated the reusable `ImageUploader` component into all three PIM application views as requested. The integration provides consistent image upload functionality with proper event handling and real-time updates.

## Components Integrated

### 1. HasImageUpload Trait (`app/Livewire/Concerns/HasImageUpload.php`)
**Purpose**: Provides consistent event handling for image upload operations across all components.

**Features**:
- Handles `images-uploaded`, `image-deleted`, and `images-reordered` events
- Provides default configuration methods that can be overridden
- Includes custom handler methods for components to implement specific behavior

### 2. ImageManager Integration (`app/Livewire/PIM/Media/ImageManager.php`)
**Changes Made**:
- Added `HasImageUpload` trait
- Replaced old upload functionality with new `ImageUploader` component
- Added toggle functionality for showing/hiding the uploader
- Updated event handling for real-time stats updates

**Configuration**:
- Model Type: `null` (unassigned images)
- Image Type: Configurable (default: main)
- Max Files: 20
- Features: Bulk upload for general image management

**Blade Template Updates** (`resources/views/livewire/pim/media/image-manager.blade.php`):
- Replaced manual upload section with `ImageUploader` component
- Added toggle functionality
- Updated image grid to work with paginated ProductImage collection

### 3. ProductView Integration (`app/Livewire/PIM/Products/Management/ProductView.php`)
**Changes Made**:
- Added `HasImageUpload` trait
- Added custom event handlers for product image refresh
- Configured for product-specific uploads

**Configuration**:
- Model Type: `product`
- Model ID: Product ID
- Multiple image type sections (main, detail, lifestyle)
- Max Files: Varies by image type (6-10)

**Blade Template Updates** (`resources/views/livewire/pim/products/management/product-view.blade.php`):
- Completely replaced images tab content
- Added separate sections for different image types
- Integrated multiple `ImageUploader` components with different configurations
- Added image count badges and statistics

### 4. VariantEdit Integration (`app/Livewire/PIM/Products/Variants/VariantEdit.php`)
**Changes Made**:
- Added `HasImageUpload` trait
- Removed old image handling properties and methods
- Added custom event handlers for variant image refresh
- Updated variant loading to include images relationship

**Configuration**:
- Model Type: `variant`
- Model ID: Variant ID
- Separate sections for main and swatch images
- Max Files: 3-6 per section

**Blade Template Updates** (`resources/views/livewire/pim/products/variants/variant-edit.blade.php`):
- Completely replaced images tab content
- Added separate sections for main and swatch images
- Updated tab badge to show correct image counts
- Added conditional display for unsaved variants

## Key Integration Features

### Real-time Updates
- Events dispatched on upload completion, deletion, and reordering
- Parent components refresh automatically to show new images
- Statistics and counters update in real-time
- Processing status updates reflected immediately

### Event Handling System
```php
// Events dispatched by ImageUploader:
'images-uploaded' => ['count', 'processed', 'model_type', 'model_id']
'image-deleted' => ['image_id']
'images-reordered' => ['ordered_ids']

// Events listened to by all components:
'image-processed' => Updates when background processing completes
'image-processing-failed' => Updates when processing fails
```

### Configuration Patterns
Each integration point uses appropriate configuration:

```php
// ImageManager - Unassigned uploads
'modelType' => null,
'maxFiles' => 20,
'showExistingImages' => false

// ProductView - Product-specific uploads
'modelType' => 'product',
'modelId' => $product->id,
'maxFiles' => 10,
'imageType' => 'main'

// VariantEdit - Variant-specific uploads  
'modelType' => 'variant',
'modelId' => $variant->id,
'maxFiles' => 6,
'imageType' => 'main'
```

### Error Handling and Validation
- File type validation (jpg, jpeg, png, webp)
- File size limits (10MB max)
- Image dimension validation (300x300px minimum)
- Processing status tracking
- User-friendly error messages

## Testing
Created comprehensive integration tests (`tests/Feature/ImageUploaderIntegrationTest.php`):
- Verifies trait integration
- Tests event dispatching
- Validates configuration
- Tests ProductImage model scopes

## Database Requirements
The integration leverages existing ProductImage model with required scopes:
- `forProduct($productId)` - Filter images for specific product
- `forVariant($variantId)` - Filter images for specific variant  
- `byType($type)` - Filter by image type
- `ordered()` - Sort by sort_order and created_at

## Usage Examples

### In ImageManager
```blade
<livewire:components.image-uploader 
    :model-type="null"
    :model-id="null"
    :image-type="$defaultImageType"
    :max-files="20"
    wire:key="image-manager-uploader"
/>
```

### In ProductView  
```blade
<livewire:components.image-uploader 
    :model-type="'product'"
    :model-id="$product->id"
    :image-type="'main'"
    :max-files="10"
    wire:key="product-main-images-{{ $product->id }}"
/>
```

### In VariantEdit
```blade
<livewire:components.image-uploader 
    :model-type="'variant'"
    :model-id="$variant->id"
    :image-type="'swatch'"
    :max-files="3"
    wire:key="variant-swatch-images-{{ $variant->id }}"
/>
```

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Consistency**: Same upload experience across all areas of the application
2. **Maintainability**: Single component to maintain for upload functionality
3. **Real-time Updates**: Immediate feedback and UI updates
4. **Type Safety**: Different configurations for different contexts
5. **Event-Driven**: Proper decoupling through Laravel Livewire events
6. **Scalability**: Easy to add new integration points using the trait
7. **User Experience**: Professional, consistent interface with drag-and-drop, previews, and progress tracking

The integration is complete and provides a robust, professional image management system throughout the PIM application.
