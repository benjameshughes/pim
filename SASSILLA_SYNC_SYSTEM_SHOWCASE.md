## 🎭 USAGE EXAMPLES

### **🔍 Check Product Sync Status**

```php
use App\Actions\Shopify\Sync\CheckSyncStatusAction;
use App\Models\Product;

$product = Product::find(1);
$statusAction = app(CheckSyncStatusAction::class);

$result = $statusAction->execute($product);

if ($result['success']) {
    $status = $result['data']['overall_status']; // healthy, needs_sync, critical, etc.
    $healthScore = $result['data']['health_score']; // 0-100
    $recommendations = $result['data']['recommendations']; // What to do next
}
```

### **🚀 Sync Products with Style**

```php
use App\Actions\Shopify\Sync\SyncProductToShopifyAction;

$syncAction = app(SyncProductToShopifyAction::class);

// Sync single product
$result = $syncAction->execute($product, [
    'method' => 'manual',
    'force' => false
]);

// Bulk sync with options
$bulkResult = $syncAction->syncBulkProducts([1, 2, 3], [
    'method' => 'automatic',
    'force' => true
]);
```

### **🔔 Setup Webhooks Like a PRO**

```php
use App\Services\Shopify\Builders\WebhookSubscriptionBuilder;
use App\Services\Shopify\API\ShopifyWebhookService;

$webhookService = app(ShopifyWebhookService::class);

// Complete sync monitoring setup
$result = WebhookSubscriptionBuilder::fullSyncMonitoring($webhookService)
    ->execute();

// Or customize your setup
$result = WebhookSubscriptionBuilder::create($webhookService)
    ->allSyncTopics()
    ->defaultCallback()
    ->withSignatureVerification()
    ->timeout(30)
    ->execute();
```

### **⚙️ Advanced Sync Configuration**

```php
use App\Services\Shopify\Builders\SyncConfigurationBuilder;

$configBuilder = SyncConfigurationBuilder::create($statusAction, $syncAction);

// Setup comprehensive monitoring
$config = $configBuilder
    ->allProducts()
    ->automatic()
    ->withMonitoring()
    ->withWebhooks()
    ->batchSize(5)
    ->emailNotifications(['admin@example.com'])
    ->daily()
    ->build();

// Execute sync with configuration
$syncResult = $configBuilder->sync();
```

## 📊 COMPREHENSIVE MONITORING

### **Health Scoring System**
Every product gets a health score (0-100) based on:
- ✅ Sync freshness (how recently synced)
- ✅ Data drift detection (differences between local and Shopify)
- ✅ Error status (any sync failures)
- ✅ Variant consistency (all variants properly synced)

### **Drift Detection**
Our AI-powered comparison engine detects:
- 💰 **Pricing Differences** (High priority)
- 📦 **Inventory Discrepancies** (Medium priority)
- 📝 **Product Information Changes** (Low priority)
- 🖼️ **Image Variations** (Low priority)

### **Real-Time Webhooks**
Monitors these critical events:
- `products/create` - New products in Shopify
- `products/update` - Product changes in Shopify
- `products/delete` - Product deletions
- `inventory_levels/update` - Stock level changes

---

## 🎯 SYNC STATUS LEVELS

| Status | Description | Health Score | Action Required |
|--------|-------------|--------------|-----------------|
| **🟢 Healthy** | Perfect sync, no drift | 90-100 | Monitor only |
| **🟡 Minor Drift** | Small differences detected | 70-89 | Sync recommended |
| **🟠 Needs Sync** | Significant differences | 50-69 | Sync required |
| **🔴 Critical** | Major issues or errors | 0-49 | Immediate attention |
| **⚪ Not Synced** | Never synced to Shopify | N/A | Initial sync needed |

---

## 🛡️ ERROR RECOVERY

Our system includes intelligent error recovery:

### **Automatic Retry Logic**
- Exponential backoff for rate limits
- Smart retry for temporary failures
- Detailed error logging with recovery suggestions

### **Error Categories**
- **Rate Limit Errors** → Automatic retry with delay
- **Authentication Errors** → Check credentials alert
- **Product Not Found** → Re-sync suggestion
- **Network Errors** → Retry with backoff

---

## 🎉 WHAT MAKES IT LEGENDARY
