## üìä Scoring Algorithm Details

### Weighted Completeness Calculation
Quality Score = (
(Mandatory Fields Completed / Total Mandatory Fields) * 60% +
(Optional Fields Completed / Total Optional Fields) * 25% +
(Image Quality Score) * 10% +
(Content Richness Score) * 5%
) * 100

### Field Categories
- **Critical (60% weight)**: Name, SKU, Price, Primary Image, Basic Description
- **Important (25% weight)**: Additional Images, Features, Detailed Description
- **Enhanced (10% weight)**: Package Dimensions, Additional Attributes
- **Marketing (5% weight)**: Marketing Copy, SEO Fields, Enhanced Images

## üé® Dashboard Enhancements

### New Quality Widgets
1. **Quality Score Distribution Chart**: Histogram showing product quality distribution
2. **Quality Trend Line**: 30-day quality improvement/decline trends
3. **Top Quality Issues**: Most common data gaps across catalog
4. **Channel Readiness Matrix**: Quality status per sales channel
5. **Quality Action Items**: Prioritized list of improvement tasks

### Interactive Quality Tools
1. **Quality Drill-Down**: Click any metric to see affected products
2. **Bulk Quality Actions**: Mass update tools for common quality issues
3. **Quality Comparison**: Before/after quality score comparisons
4. **Quality Benchmarking**: Compare against industry standards
