foreach ($migrationFiles as $file => $description) {

}

echo "🧹 CLEANUP ACTIONS:\n";
echo "-------------------\n";
echo "  ❌ DROP TABLE: teams\n";
echo "  ❌ DROP TABLE: team_user\n";
echo "  ✅ CREATE: roles table (admin, manager, user)\n"; 
echo "  ✅ CREATE: permissions table (241 permissions)\n";
echo "  ✅ CREATE: model_has_roles, model_has_permissions, role_has_permissions\n\n";

echo "👥 USER DATA HANDLING:\n";
echo "----------------------\n";
echo "  🔄 All existing users will be assigned 'user' role by default\n";
echo "  🔄 User ID 1 will automatically get 'admin' role (via UserObserver)\n";
echo "  🔄 All user accounts and data preserved\n";
echo "  🔄 Only team relationships are removed\n\n";

echo "💾 DATA PRESERVATION:\n";
echo "---------------------\n";
echo "  ✅ Users table: PRESERVED\n";
echo "  ✅ Products, variants, images: PRESERVED\n";
echo "  ✅ All business data: PRESERVED\n";
echo "  ❌ Team memberships: REMOVED (no longer needed)\n\n";

echo "🎯 POST-MIGRATION STATE:\n";
echo "------------------------\n";
echo "  • Clean permission-based authorization system\n";
echo "  • User ID 1 has full admin access\n";
echo "  • All other users have basic 'user' role\n";
echo "  • You can then assign admin/manager roles as needed\n\n";

echo "🚨 IMPORTANT NOTES:\n";
echo "-------------------\n";
echo "  1. Your images are stored in storage/ - they will be preserved\n";
echo "  2. All product data remains intact\n";
echo "  3. Only the authorization structure changes\n";
echo "  4. After migration, manually assign admin/manager roles to specific users\n\n";

echo "⚡ SUGGESTED POST-MIGRATION STEPS:\n";
echo "----------------------------------\n";
echo "  1. php artisan migrate --force\n";
echo "  2. php artisan db:seed --class=RoleAndPermissionSeeder --force\n";  
echo "  3. Assign roles to specific users:\n";
echo "     php artisan tinker\n";
echo "     User::find(2)->assignRole('admin');  // Make user 2 an admin\n";
echo "     User::find(3)->assignRole('manager'); // Make user 3 a manager\n\n";

echo "✅ CONCLUSION: Safe to redeploy! Your data will be preserved and cleaned up automatically.\n";
